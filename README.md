This is a WIP boilerplate repo for building and testing single-page browser
applications using React. It will be updated and upgraded as libraries evolve.
The supported projects are smaller demonstrators and locally-run clients.

Libraries used:
- Browserify for bundling
- Gulp for building
- Jest for testing
- CoffeeScript (supported)

Niceties:
- Automatic rebuilds using Watchify
- Development server using `connect`

Todo:
- Bundle minifaction
- Dynamic bundle loading
- Live reload of development server
- Parameterize build for dev/production
- CSS preprocessing
- Babel for ES6 support
- JSX support
- CSX support
- Transition to pure Jasmine/`jsdom` tests?
